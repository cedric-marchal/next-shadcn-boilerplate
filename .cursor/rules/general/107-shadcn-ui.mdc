## Context

* We use Shadcn/UI to style our application.

## Rules

- You must use Shadcn UI for components.
- You must use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- You must install any ShadcnUI missing component with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name />`
- When using the Button component from shadcn/ui, always explicitly define the type attribute. If no type is provided, default to type="button" to prevent unintended form submissions.
